    <h2>Best Movies of All Time (or most enjoyable) according to me</h2>
    <hr size="3" noshade color="#C7000F">
    <ul>
        <li><h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_the%2520fellow">LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring</a></h3></li>
        <p>The epitome of the adventure story. How does one seemingly average individual goes on to shape the history of <em>Middle</em> Earth.</p>
        <li><h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1605783/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_midnight%2520in%2520">Midnight in Paris</a></h3></li>
        <p>Why does everyone always romanticize the past? Be present and enjoy the moment, it is the <em>best and only</em> thing we've got.</p>
        <li><h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_the%2520go">The Godfather: Part I</a></h3></li>
        <p>Historic movie that immerses you in the life of Gangsters at the height of their power. One does not simply refuse the Don, or the fact that this is one of the best movies ever made.</p>
    </ul>
